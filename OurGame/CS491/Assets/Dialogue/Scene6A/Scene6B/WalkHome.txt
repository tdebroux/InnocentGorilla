Oh, I missed a couple of call from Douglas. Should probably listen to his message.

Fred, the investigation has concluded and found that it was a simple mistake. I'm truly sorry for the trouble. 
The man who had withdrew the funds has since returned it once the bank had looked into it. 
This whole ordeal was less than appealing but it was necessary. You may come back to work starting Monday. 
We've also greenlit organizing the towns festival and would like you to take the lead on this project. 
Looking forward to hearing back from you, bye.

Well, I didn't lose my job, so that's nice. But do I want it?
I never had a social life working there, but maybe now is my chance? 
Ernie and his friends seem like a fun group of people and they really do need my help, especially now that Douglas is getting involved. 
Not only that, it was such an amazing experience to play in a band again under Dr. Weber. 
It would be an amazing experience and an incredible opportunity to perform for the town. 
There's just something about being up on stage and playing that has always spoken to me. 
Though any one of these tasks will be enough to fill my plate. Which one do I want to pick? 
I should probably head inside and think this over.
