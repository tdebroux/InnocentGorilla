Hey DingDong, are you finished?
(switch) Player 4 5
I have not, no. Why do you ask?
(switch) Player 6 7
hm...okay. I'll look at them later, just place them in a separate pile and put them in my office. Have you seen the email I sent you with details about a potential new client?
(switch) Player 8 9
Good, tomorrow I want you to create a proposal so we can try and bring them in. I realize it's a Saturday, but this needs to happen before they decide to go with someone else.
(switch) Player 10 11
Glad to hear it, I'll talk to you then.
