Awesome! You showed up. Here, I’ll introduce you to everyone
"Everyone, this is Freddy! He's an old friend of mine from school that I haven't seen in a while.
Character, this is Eric and Sarah
(switch) Eric
Hi.
(switch) Sarah
Hello.
(switch) Player
"Hi guys, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've seen you a bit around town"
(switch) Eric
"Likewise."
(switch) Sarah
"Yeah, you were walking around town earlier today."
(switch) Player
"So how's it been going Ernie? You mentioned that you are still working as an artist?"
(switch) Ernie
"Yeah! It’s had its ups and downs, though I wouldn’t trade it for the world."
"I'm actually trying to organize an open gallery for a festival that's in the works."
(switch) Player
"Yeah, I've heard a little about something like that, I told my boss about it and he was going to see if he wanted to organize it."
(switch) Ernie
"Yeah, it's shaping up to be something special should everything go along as planned."
"There will be an open gallery featuring local artists and a performance from the local orchestra."
(switch) Player
"Sounds like a great opportunity for you guys."
(switch) Ernie
"It truly is. You want to help us organize the gallery?"
"It'd be great to hang out with you again and this is kind of what your company does, isn’t it?"
(switch) Player
"Yeah, sort of. We take on clients looking to organize various events or anything requiring a lot of logistics."
"They pay us a small fee plus the costs of whatever they are organizing and we make it happen."
"I tended organize larger events, but we have wedding planners and other people for more specialized events.”
(switch) Ernie
"Sounds like you’d be a great help to have helping us.”
(switch) Player
"I’ll have to get back to you on that, I have no idea what’s going on with work but I’ll definitely keep it in mind.”
(switch) Ernie
“That’s all I can really ask for. Anyway, let’s mingle a little.”
A few hours pass as you've gone about the room and talked to everyone. 
(switch) Player
"Anyway, I think it's about time I head home. Bye guys, had a wonderful time."
(switch) Ernie
"Bye!"
(switch) Sarah
"Take it easy. Hope to see you again soon!"
(switch) Eric
"See you around."
