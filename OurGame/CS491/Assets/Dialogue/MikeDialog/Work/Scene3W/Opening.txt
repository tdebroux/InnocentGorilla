Do you have any update on how the festival is coming, Fred?

I've got a lot of vendors, sponsors, and enough volunteers to man everything.
Now is time to organize the layout and scheduling of everything.

That's excellent work, Fred. Over these last few weeks you've really gone above and beyond, working weekends, putting in the hours. 
It reminds me a lot of me when I first started, the type of attitude that allowed me to grow this company to where it is today.

Thank you, sir, it means a lot.
(switch) Douglas
Well, you deserve it. 
Keep working like this and showing your worth, there's likely to be a position opening above you that I feel you'd be well suited for.
(switch) Player
That sounds great. Thanks for letting me know.
(switch) Douglas
No problem, Fred. Head home, you've earned it.
(switch) Player
Thanks! I'm just going to finish up a little more work then I'll head out.
(switch) Douglas
Of course. I offer you the rest of the night off, and you're still going to work.

Fred sends a few more emails taking only a few minutes.

Well, considering I just got the rest of the day off, I'm free to do anything for a while. 
Though I should probably head home and get some rest at some point.
