Oh, it seems that I missed a call. I wonder who from? 
I guess I missed two. I have messages from Ernie and Dr. Weber. What do they want?

The first message plays. 
(switch) Ernie
Hey Fred, I know you're super busy with preparing for your show, though I was curious if it'd be possible if you could still lend us a hand if you have the spare time? 
I know you're good at organizing these types of events and frankly, there have been a few kinks that we've been struggling to iron out. 
We could really use your expertise if you could lend it. If you can help, just give me a call or stop on over, thanks.

Sounds like he could use some help. Not sure if I have the time though...

(switch) Weber
Hi! Sorry to disturb you, though we could really use your help. 
We're running low on funding for the setup of our stage over at the festival grounds and will need more volunteers.
Considering this is what you do, I was wondering if you could help us raise some more funds and finding more volunteers.
Any help you could give would be appreciated, thanks.

They both sound like they need the help, but I know this'll take up a considerable amount of time that I'd have to take off from work.

Should you wish to continue working, head to bed so you are able to head to work in the morning. 
Otherwise, should you wish to help Ernie or Dr. Weber, you should go talk to them.
