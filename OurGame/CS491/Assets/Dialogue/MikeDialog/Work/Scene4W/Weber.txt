Fred! You got my message! How lovely of you to stop by!
(switch) Player
It's no problem, really. How can I help? You seemed like you were in a bit of a bind.
(switch) Weber
That's for sure. We need more help raising some funds and sponsors for our show to cover our expenses for the stage.
As well to fund hiring a few stage hands.
(switch) Player
That's doable, I'll be happy to do what I can. 
I had a few sponsors that didn't want to support the festival directly, but maybe they will support a band.
I'll make a few calls.
