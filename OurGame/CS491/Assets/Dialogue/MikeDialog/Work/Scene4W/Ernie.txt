Hey! Fred! You got my message? 
(switch) Player
Yeah, I did. I'm here to help. How can I help?
(switch) Ernie
Well, we need a few more volunteers to help us set up, and dealing with the scheduling.
(switch) Player
Alright, this is fixable, but it'll take a bit of work. 
I'd say we offer free admission to the festival plus access to some food once the gallery is closed for the volunteers.
(switch) Ernie
That should work, yeah. 
(switch) Player
I'll begin drumming up some more volunteers in the park.
(switch) Ernie
Sure thing! And thanks for the help. It means a lot that you'd take some time away to help us out. 
(switch) Player
Don't mention it. Anyway, I'm off to the park.
