Fred, you've really proven yourself, even after your suspension, you came back working as hard as ever.
Once this festival has been completed, the Vice President slot will have opened up. I'd like you to take it.

Good. Now finish up here, the festival is only a few days away. Also, prepare your speech. You'll be giving one at the opening ceremony.

Right, I'll get started on that right way, sir.
