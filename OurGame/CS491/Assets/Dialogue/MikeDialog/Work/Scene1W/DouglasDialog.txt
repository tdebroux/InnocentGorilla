Fred! I'm glad to see you. So, I take it you'll be coming back to work for us then?
(switch) Player
Yes sir, while the work can be hard, I love what I do here.
(switch) Douglas
I'm glad to hear it, because honestly, we don't exactly have anyone that can replace you. 
But otherwise, you'll need to find vendors to attend the festival, sponsors, volunteers, events, and anything else you can think of.
(switch) Player
Sure thing, sir. I'll get started immediately.
