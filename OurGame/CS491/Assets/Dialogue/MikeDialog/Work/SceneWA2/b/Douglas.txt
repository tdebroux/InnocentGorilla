Hey, Fred. Is your speech done? 
(switch) Player
Yeah, took a while but it's done.

There are a few things I'd like you to mention while you're up there. 
Let the people know that the band performance and the art gallery will be a little delayed due to some unforseen circumstances.
It should be okay though, they just need a bit more time.
(switch) Player
Sure thing
(switch) Douglas
Anyway, you're up. Head up to the microphone when you're ready.
