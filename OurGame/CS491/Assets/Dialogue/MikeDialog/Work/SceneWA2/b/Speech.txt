I'd like to give thanks to sponsors, vendors, and everyone who has shown up to make this festival something special.
It has really come together to be something great, to celebrate our 100th year anniversary as a town.
I'd like to give thanks to Dr. Weber, for organizing her band to perform for all of us.
As well as Ernest Fletcher, who has organized an art gallery for all of us to view of some of the best local artists. 
Though please know, that there will be a slight delay on the opening of both events due to some unforeseen circumstances.
I hope you all have a wonderful time!

It's strange how your life can make such drastic changes in such little time. 
A bit over a month ago I was working for Douglas, working weekends and overtime. 
I liked the work, and saw the change that I could make, so after my suspension I went back.
Now, I've managed to become the new Vice President of the company. 
I may have messed up those accounts, and mistakes were made. I failed. 
But just because I failed, it didn't mean it was the end of the world. 
More opportunities arose and through hard work and dedication I was able to take control and move forward.
