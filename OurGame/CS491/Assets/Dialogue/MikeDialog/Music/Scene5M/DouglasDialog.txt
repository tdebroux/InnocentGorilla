Oh, Fred! You're here! I'm assuming you got my message then? 
(switch) Player
Yeah, sure thing. Sure, I decided to part ways, but I always did like this place, for better or for worse.
Plus, I have a bit of a vested interest in the festival going well.  
(switch) Douglas
Well, I'm glad you've decided to come work for us again, even if it's temporary. 
We could really use the help. We've been juggling multiple vendors and are having trouble keeping everything organized. 
This is what you'll be tasked with managing.
(switch) Player
Sounds... managable I guess, if a bit time consuming. 
(switch) Douglas
Yes, it will be. 
But I'm sure you'll be able to do it! 
Your old desk is still open, all the information you'll need is there.
(switch) Player
Great. I'll get started. 
Wow, a lot of vendors.
This festival grounds plan needs to be almost entirely reworked and a schedule ironed out for the main activities.
This'll take a few days,
