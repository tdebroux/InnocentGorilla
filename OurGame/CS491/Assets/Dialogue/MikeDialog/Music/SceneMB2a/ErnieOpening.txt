Wow, it's taken a few days but we've done it! 
We really owe you a lot, Fred. We do appreciate the help you have us.

It's really not a problem. I can always find time to help a friend.

Well, hopefully I'll be able to get away to come watch your show with the new volunteers.

I hope so, it'd mean a lot to have you there. Here's a ticket to the front row.

Wow! Thanks. I'll do my best to be there.

Will see you there. I need to head to practice at the theater. Bye!
