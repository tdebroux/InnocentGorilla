It's strange how your life can make such drastic changes in such little time. 
A bit over a month ago I was working for Douglas, working weekends and overtime. 
I liked the work, but sometimes it seems like he expected a little too much. 
Now, I've rediscovered my passion for music and am performing in front of a crowd. 
I may have messed up those accounts, and mistakes were made. I failed. 
But just because I failed, it didn't mean it was the end of the world. 
More opportunities arose and through hard work and dedication I was able to take control and move forward.
