Great! We are really shaping up for our upcoming performance and I'm sure it'll go off without a hitch.
And as the date is fast approaching, which means we need to select our first chair. 
Even though they are a recent addition, they have put in many, many hours, and dedicated themselves to this group.
Please, give a round of applause for Fred, our new first chair!
