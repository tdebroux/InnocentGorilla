A few hours passed, the gallery opened and closed. People inspected the art, took pictures, and asked questions.
It went really well and everyone liked it.

Fred! Wow, that went amazingly. It was an experience of a lifetime!
(switch) Player
It sure was. I had a great time, everyone loved your art. 
(switch) Ernie
They did. It's a shame you didn't submit anything, though. 
(switch) Player
Yeah, it's a bit of a missed opportunity. 
(switch) Ernie
A little, but I'm sure there will be more. 
Hey, we're all heading out for a little after party. 
You want to go? 
(switch) Player
Of course! Let's go!

It's strange how your life can make such drastic changes in such little time. 
A bit over a month ago I was working for Douglas, working weekends and overtime. 
I liked the work, and saw the change that I could make, so after my suspension I went back.
Now, I've helped organize a local art gallery and it was really well received. 
I may have messed up those accounts while working for Douglas, and mistakes were made. I failed. 
But just because I failed, it didn't mean it was the end of the world. 
More opportunities arose and through hard work and dedication I was able to take control and move forward. 

-THE END-
