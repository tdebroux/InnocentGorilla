Oh, Fred! Did you get my message? Does that mean you're going to help us out?
(switch) Player
Of course. What exactly do you need help with?
(switch) Ernie
Awesome! Thanks man. Basically, we're not stupid or anything, but we're all artists. 
We could organize this well enough, but this is what you do. 
We wanted to bring you on to help make sure everything goes smoothly.
(switch) Player
Ha! Of course, it's no problem. I can certainly do that, but I'll need your help in all this.
(switch) Ernie
Don't even worry about it, you know I'll help. I even have a few friends too. 
(switch) Player
Awesome, first things first, do you think you'll need help outside of the people presenting to set things up?
(switch) Ernie
Ernie: Yeah, probably.
(switch) Player
Well if that's the case, then you'll probably need to get some volunteers.
(switch) Ernie
I can do that, I kinda have a way with people, that and I know a few folks who might be willing to help out.
(switch) Player
Sure thing, then I'll take care of getting schedules organized, organizing jobs, and get a floor plan laid out.
(switch) Ernie
Sounds great!
(switch) Player
I'll get started then.
