Hey! We're almost done here, thanks to your awesome skills. 
Wish I could say the same for everything else though. 
The band is going to be running a little bit late due to some unforeseen circumstances.
That and the opening of the festival is delayed a bit so vendors can still get set up.

Wow, that's unfortunate. I'm sure everything will turn out okay though. 
(switch) Ernie
Yeah, everything should be fine. But we've gotten everything hung up including your painting. 
(switch) Player
Well thanks! 
(switch) Ernie
Now we just wait for it to open.
