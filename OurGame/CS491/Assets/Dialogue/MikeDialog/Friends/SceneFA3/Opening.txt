A few hours passed, the gallery opened and closed. People inspected the art, took pictures, and asked questions.
It went really well and everyone was generally pleased.

It sure was. I heard a lot of good things about my painting as well.

Because it is good, Fred. Though hey, we're all heading out for a little after party. 
You want to go?

It's strange how your life can make such drastic changes in such little time. 
A bit over a month ago I was working for Douglas, working weekends and overtime. 
I liked the work, and saw the change that I could make, so after my suspension I went back.
Now, I've submitted a paiting to a local art gallery and it was actually well recieved. 
I may have messed up those accounts while working for Douglas, and mistakes were made. I failed. 
But just because I failed, it didn't mean it was the end of the world. 
More opportunities arrose and through hard work and dedication I was able to take control and move forward. 

-THE END-
