A few hours passed, the gallery opened and closed. People inspected the art, took pictures, and asked questions.
It went well and everyone liked it.

Fred! Wow, that went amazingly. It was an experience of a lifetime!
(switch) Player
It sure was. I heard a lot of good things about my painting as well.

Because it is good, Fred. Though hey, we're all heading out for a little after party. 
You want to go? 
(switch) Player
Of course! Let's go!

It's strange how your life can make such drastic changes in such little time. 
A bit over a month ago I was working for Douglas, working weekends and overtime. 
I liked the work, and saw the change that I could make, so after my suspension I went back.
Now, I've submitted a painting to a local art gallery and it was actually well received. 
I may have messed up those accounts while working for Douglas, and mistakes were made. I failed. 
But just because I failed, it didn't mean it was the end of the world. 
More opportunities arose and through hard work and dedication I was able to take control and move forward. 

-THE END-
