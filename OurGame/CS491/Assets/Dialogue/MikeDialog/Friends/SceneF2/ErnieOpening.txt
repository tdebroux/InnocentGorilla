A few days pass as you begin your work on organizing the gallery.

How has the hunt for volunteers been going? 
(switch) Ernie
Great, actually. Here's a list of names and their availability. 
(switch) Player
Awesome. I'll get a schedule organized then. I've finished the floor plan, but I've still got to assign jobs. 
(switch) Ernie
Sounds good. There is one thing I wanted to ask though. Would you want to try and submit a piece to be shown in the gallery? 
(switch) Player
I'm not exactly the greatest artist around. 
(switch) Ernie
All of us here could help teach you. We've got an empty space, c'mon. You've got to!
(switch) Player
Well, how's this? we'll work on teaching me to paint, and I'll start painting something over the next few weeks for the festival. 
Though, I've still got to focus on getting everything finished first. 
(switch) Ernie
Awesome! I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time. Want to start? 
(switch) Player
I guess? 
(switch) Ernie
Cool, I've got a canvas over here already set up.
