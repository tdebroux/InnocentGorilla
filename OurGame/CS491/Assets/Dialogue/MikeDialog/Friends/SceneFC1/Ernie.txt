Hey! You finally finish up that work for your old boss? 
(switch) Player
Yeah, it took a while, sorry. How're things going here? 
(switch) Ernie
Great, we've got everything squared away for the festival tomorrow. 
It's a shame you won't have a piece to present though. 
(switch) Player
Yeah, sorry about that.
(switch) Ernie
It's not a problem. 
(switch) Player
I just wanted to stop by and check in. 
Probably going to head home and rest for the festival tomorrow. 
(switch) Ernie
We'll see you there!
