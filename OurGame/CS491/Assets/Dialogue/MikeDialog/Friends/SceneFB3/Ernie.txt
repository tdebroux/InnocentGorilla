Hey! We're almost done here, thanks to your awesome skills. 
Though, the opening of the festival is delayed a bit so vendors can still get set up. 
(switch) Player
Wow, that's unfortunate. I'm sure everything will turn out okay though. 
(switch) Ernie
Yeah, everything should be fine. But we've gotten everything hung up, though we put something else in your place. 
(switch) Player
Yeah, sorry about that.
(switch) Ernie
It's not a problem, we just put another one of mine in there. 
Anyway, now we just have to wait for it to open.
