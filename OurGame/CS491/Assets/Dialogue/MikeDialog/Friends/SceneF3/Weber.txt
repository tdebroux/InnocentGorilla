Fred! I'm so glad you came!
(switch) Player
How could I abandon my favorite teacher in her time of need? 
(switch) Weber
Oh, stop. But really, thank you. 
(switch) Player
So, you just need some help raising some extra funding?
(switch) Weber
Yes. We need to find funding for the stage and hiring on the stage hands.
(switch) Player
Sure thing. I know a few places I could reach out too to gain you some sponsorships.
It'll take a while to iron out the details. But I'm sure I can get it done.
(switch) Weber
Great! If you need any help, feel free to ask!
(switch) Player
No problem.
