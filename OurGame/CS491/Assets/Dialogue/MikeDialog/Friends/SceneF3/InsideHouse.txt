Oh, I've got a few messages, one from Dr. Weber and another from Douglas.

Fred, we realize that you've part your ways, though with the circumstances regarding your departure...
Has left us in a bit of a bind as we don't have someone else with your skill set within the company to organize this festival with your specialty. 
There have been a few hiccups that we could really use your help resolving, and we'd offer you a special contract to help us deal with this.
Which includes a sizable pay increase as an apology for this whole situation you've been placed in. 
We hope to hear back from you, thanks.

Hi! Sorry to disturb you, though we could really use your help. 
We're running low on funding for the setup of our stage over at the festival grounds and will need more volunteers.
Considering this is what you do, I was wondering if you could help us raise some more funds and finding more volunteers.
Any help you could give would be appreciated, thanks.

This puts me in a bit of a bind. They both need the help, but if I go help them, I'll likely not finish my project for the gallery. What should I do? 
I guess I'll go talk to whoever I choose to help, or go just head back to bed and go back to Ernie's in the morning.
