Fred, you've made it. Thank god. 
(change) Player
Yeah, it sounded like you really needed the help. 
And well, you were good to me, so I wanted to see what I could do.
(change) Douglas
Well, thank you. We could really use the help.
We've been juggling multiple vendors and are having trouble keeping everything organized.
This is what you'll be tasked with managing.

Sounds doable, if not a bit time consuming. 
(switch) Douglas 
Yes, it will be. But I'm sure you'll be able to do it!
Your old desk is still open, all the information you'll need is there.
(switch) Player
Wonderful, I'll get started immediately.
