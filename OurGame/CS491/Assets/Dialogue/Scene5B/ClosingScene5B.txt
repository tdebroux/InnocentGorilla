Guys, I'd like to introduce you to Fred, who was one of my most gifted students. 
I've been trying to convince him to fill our vacancy.

Oh, uh. Hello everyone. 
(switch) Orchestra
Hey there! 
(switch) Player
As I had said, not exactly sure if I'll be able to, even though this does sound like quite the opportunity. 
I'll keep the offer in mind though. Besides I haven't actually played in quite a while. 
(switch) Weber
Oh hush. I'm sure you'll play as well as ever with a little bit of practice. 
Speaking of, I'd like to invite you to sit in on our practice tomorrow morning. 
I'd like for you to at least try and play with us before you make your decision. 
(switch) Player
That sounds fair, sure. I'd love to. Though before I go, I do just want to say you guys played wonderfully. 
(switch) Orchestra
Why thank you. It's truly a team effort. 
(switch) Player
Anyway, I really should be heading home. You guys have a wonderful rest of your night.
