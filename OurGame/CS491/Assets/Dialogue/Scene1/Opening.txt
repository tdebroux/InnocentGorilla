This is the worst part of my day. Sorting through our mail. 
It's always such a mess. Why can't someone else do this?

You continue to sift through the papers. 
You notice that there are serveral letters asking for help organize a local festival.

You about done, Fred?
(switch) Player
About. You hear of this festival that people are planning? 
(switch) Douglas
No. Why?
(switch) Player
We have a few letters asking for it. Seems like a good opportunity. 
(switch) Douglas
If you say so. Gather the details and create a proposal for them. See if we can't get this underway quickly. 
(switch) Player
Sure thing. I'll just finish up here. I should have it to you by Monday. 
(switch) Douglas
Glad to hear it. Have a nice weekend. 
(switch) Player
You too.

Great. Now I've just lost my weekend. 
This job takes a lot of hard work, but at least the things I do make a difference. 
Anyway, I should probably head over to my PC and enter in these financials.
After I've submitted that, I should head home.
