Well, back in '93 I was a traveling jazz musician.

Yeah, I did a few late night shows, jazz clubs, and even got asked to play at a white house event. 
I was on the verge of stardom, but I decided the fast paced life was too much for me.
Anyways, somewhere in there people started calling me "Dizzy W.".
