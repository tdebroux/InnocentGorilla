Ugh... This is the part of my day I am least looking forward too.
You'd think at some point they'd hire an assistant to take care of this...
There are a few requests for support from local groups trying to organize a festival, looks 
like the idea is to celebrate the centenial year of our town

Hey DingDong, are you finished?
(switch) Player
Almost.. Just a small pile left and a few more accounts to enter. Have you heard of this festival that is coming up in a few months?
(switch) Douglas
I have not, no. Why do you ask?
(switch) Player
There are several letters here from local groups asking for aid in organizing and funding for the anniversary of our town's founding.
(switch) Douglas
hm...okay. I'll look at them later, just place them in a separate pile and put them in my office. 
Have you seen the email I sent you with details about a potential new client?
(switch) Player
I have, yes.
(switch) Douglas
Good, tomorrow I want you to create a proposal so we can try and bring them in. 
I realize it's a Saturday, but this needs to happen before they decide to go with someone else.
(switch) Player
Understood. I'll have it to you by Monday.
(switch) Douglas
Glad to hear it, I'll talk to you then.
(switch) Player
Great.. Now I've just lost my weekend. I love what I do, but sometimes it's just too much. 
Oh well, let's just focus at the task at hand.
(startgame)
Now to get home and get some sleep before I start on this proposal.
