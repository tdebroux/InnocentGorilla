Your phone vibrates. A phone call from Douglas. 
(switch) Player
Douglas? I wonder what he wants. 
Hello?
(switch) Douglas
Yes, Fred. Hello. Did you double check your accounts before you submitted them last night? 
(switch) Player
Yes, always. Why? 
(switch) Douglas
Well, it would seem that the bills that you paid, were sent to incorrect accounts. 
And that money has not been accounted for. The money's gone. 
(switch) Player
What?! This has to be an honest mistake. 
(switch) Douglas 
Clearly, though we still must investigate this. 
While we aren't saying you are guilty, we have to investigate you for embezzlement.
(switch) Player
That's ridiculous! You know I would never steal our company’s money!
(switch) Douglas
Until we know for sure, consider yourself suspended until further notice. *click*
(switch) Null
The line goes dead.
(switch) Player
No! No no no!
This is just insane.
