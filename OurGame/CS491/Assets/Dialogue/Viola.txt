Hi Gus!
(switch) Gus
My wife played the viola her whole life before she passed away last fall.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Well, I just don't think I'll ever get the fact she's not here, but music is my way of coping.
A few months after she passed, I dusted of this here viola and began to learn it in her honor.

Aw shucks.
