Hi Dr. Weber.

Why so glum?

Might've just lost my job. It appears I made a mistake and now I'm unsure if I'll have a job tomorrow.

That's horrible. I'm sorry to hear that. It seems you have grown a lot since you were in my class. Are you still practicing your violin?
You were a real talent!

I haven't really had the time, I guess I let it fall to the way side once I started working.

That's a shame, as I'm looking for a violinist for a small upcoming performance at a festival we're trying to organize.
Why don't you come by and apply? You were one of my most gifted students.

Well, I don't know Dr. Weber. I appreciate the offer, though I'm still unsure of what's going to happen to my career.

In that case, why don't you just come down to one of our shows that we're putting on later this week at the theater?
Get your mind off your problems and get a feel for what we're like.
(switch) Player
Yeah, I can do that. Sounds like a good change of pace. When is it?
(switch) Weber
Excellent! Two days from now, 8 PM! I'll see you there!
(switch) Player
Looking forward to it.

Hey before you leave, I think I saw Eric down the river by the bridge. You should go say hi!
