Oh! Fred, hello! How are you?
(switch) Player
I'm doing great actually, I've finally made my decision. 
(switch) Weber
Hmm? And what would that be? 
(switch) Player
I've decided I'll take the open spot. I want to perform. 
(switch) Weber
Delightful! I'm sure the band will be just as excited as I am. 
I'm sure you'll find that once you begin to perform on stage again, nothing else comes close. 
(switch) Player
That's kind of what I'm hoping for. I can't really believe I stopped playing for these past few years. 
It was such a passion of mine. I guess life rarely takes you where you thought it would. 
(switch) Weber
Isn't that the truth? 
Anyway, here's a few things that you'll need. Things like a practice schedule, important dates. 
Also please fill this out. It just lets me know your sizes so I can get any uniform ahead of time. 
(switch) Player
Thanks. Sounds good, I'll have that done before our next practice. And from the looks of it, that's tonight?
(switch) Weber
Yup! Though, one more thing before you leave. The first chair is still open.
I remember how hard you worked last time to get it. 
(switch) Player
I'll be sure to keep that in mind, thanks again. 
(switch) Weber
Don't mention it. See you later tonight.
