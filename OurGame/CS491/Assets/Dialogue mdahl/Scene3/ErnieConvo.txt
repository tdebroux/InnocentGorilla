Character! Hey!
(switch) Player
Hey there, Ernie. How've you been?
(switch) Ernie
Good! It's been a while!
(switch) Player
That sounds great, I'm happy for you. Wish I could say things have been going as well for me.
(switch) Ernie
Oh, what going on?
(switch) Player
I made a mistake and cost my company some money, now they are trying to see if I did it on purpose or not.
Not sure if I'll have a job tomorrow.
(switch) Ernie
Wow, man. That's rough. I understand where you’re coming from though.
Life of an artist isn’t all that everyone cracked it up to be, though I do still love what I do.
Y'know what? We haven't hung out in a while, why don't you stop by my place later tonight?
I'm having a few friends over and I'd love for you to join us. It'll help you relax a bit.
(switch) Player
Considering all this time on my hands, sure why not. What time?
(switch) Ernie
About 8 or so.
(switch) Player
I'll see you then, talk to you later.
*I should probably head home and get ready for Ernies after my walk.*
